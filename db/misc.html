The default registration form only includes fields for the user's name, e-mail address, and password. However, what if you wanted to additionally ask for a username or perhaps a location such as the user's country? Fortunately, Laravel's authentication implementation makes this an incredibly easy task.

I'll walk you through an example in which we require the user to additionally provide a unique username. Begin by updating the users table to include a username field:

$ php artisan make:migration add_username_field_to_users_table --table=users

Open the newly created migration file and modify the up method to look like this:

Schema::table('users', function(Blueprint $table)
{
$table->string('username');
});

Modify the down method to look like this:

Schema::table('users', function(Blueprint $table)
{
$table->dropColumn('username');
});

Run the migration and then open the resources/auth/register.blade.php form we created earlier in the chapter. Add a field for accepting the username:

<div class="form-group">
{!! Form::label('username', 'Your Username') !!}
{!! Form::text('username', null, 
    ['class'=>'form-control', 'placeholder'=>'Username']) !!}
</div>

Of course, Laravel won't automatically know what to do with this field, therefore you'll need to make one last change. Open the AuthController.php controller found in app/Http/Controllers/Auth, and modify the validator method to look like this:

protected function validator(array $data)
{
return Validator::make($data, [
  'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
  'username' => 'required|string|unique:users',
  'email' => 'required|email|max:255|unique:users',
  'password' => 'required|confirmed|min:6'
]);
}

Next, scroll down and modify the create method to look like this:

protected function create(array $data)
{
return User::create([
'name' => $data['name'],
'email' => $data['email'],
'username' => $data['username'],
'password' => bcrypt($data['password'])
]);
}

Save these changes, and only one step remains. Open the app/User.php file and add the username field to the $fillable property like so:

protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password', 'username'];

After saving the changes to the User model, believe it or not you're ready to register users with usernames! It really is that easy.
